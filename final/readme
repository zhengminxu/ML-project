codes are in src/
if you just want to fine tune, apply my_fine_tune.py to the previous output answers

from scratch:
for the followings, if you adjust nb_cluster to be less than the file numbers in each directory, please remove all the files in each directory before running codes
run cluster.py to get required files ready (can adjust nb_cluster in it, store in /clusters as csv format and the s_probs in /probs)
run count_n_grams_fine_tune.py to get tags (store in /cluster_tags)
run merge.py to merge all answers in /cluster_tags to /merge_resluts/result.csv (this is the answer before fine-tuning)
run my_fine_tune.py to fine-tune /merge_resluts/result.csv to /merge_resluts/tuned.csv
